# 📋 EventEase — Smart Workshop & Event Registration System
⚠️ The code is currently named power-bi-bootcamp as it was built specifically for a Power BI Bootcamp event. However, the system is completely reusable and customizable for any future events, workshops, webinars, or bootcamps — just update the form content and branding.


A complete end-to-end registration platform built for organizing tech bootcamps and workshops. Designed with simplicity and functionality in mind — this system lets participants register, pay via UPI, upload payment proof, and instantly receive confirmation emails. Admins can securely track all registrations in real-time through a protected dashboard.
